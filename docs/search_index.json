Some example applications of machine learning in practice include: Predicting the likelihood of a patient returning to the hospital (readmission) within 30 days of discharge. Segmenting customers based on common attributes or purchasing behavior for targeted marketing. Predicting coupon redemption rates for a given marketing campaign. Predicting customer churn so an organization can perform preventative intervention. And many more! In essence, these tasks all seek to learn from data. To address each scenario, we can use a given set of features to train an algorithm and extract insights. These algorithms, or learners, can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision needed during training. 2.1 Learning objectives This lesson will introduce you to some fundamental concepts around ML and this class. By the end of this lesson you will: Be able to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Know when a problem is considered a regression or classification problem. Be able to import and explore the data sets we’ll use through various examples. 2.2 Supervised learning A predictive model is used for tasks that involve the prediction of a given output (or target) using other variables (or features) in the data set. The learning algorithm in a predictive model attempts to discover and model the relationships among the target variable (the variable being predicted) and the other features (aka predictor variables). Examples of predictive modeling include: using customer attributes to predict the probability of the customer churning in the next 6 weeks; using home attributes to predict the sales price; using employee attributes to predict the likelihood of attrition; using patient attributes and symptoms to predict the risk of readmission; using production attributes to predict time to market. Each of these examples has a defined learning task; they each intend to use attributes (\\(X\\)) to predict an outcome measurement (\\(Y\\)). Throughout this course we’ll use various terms interchangeably for \\(X\\): “predictor variable”, “independent variable”, “attribute”, “feature”, “predictor” \\(Y\\): “target variable”, “dependent variable”, “response”, “outcome measurement” The predictive modeling examples above describe what is known as supervised learning. The supervision refers to the fact that the target values provide a supervisory role, which indicates to the learner the task it needs to learn. Specifically, given a set of data, the learning algorithm attempts to optimize a function (the algorithmic steps) to find the combination of feature values that results in a predicted value that is as close to the actual target output as possible. In supervised learning, the training data you feed the algorithm includes the target values. Consequently, the solutions can be used to help supervise the training process to find the optimal algorithm parameters. Most supervised learning problems can be bucketed into one of two categories, regression or classification, which we discuss next. 2.2.1 Regression problems When the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a numeric outcome, we refer to this as a regression problem (not to be confused with linear regression modeling). Regression problems revolve around predicting output that falls on a continuum. In the examples above, predicting home sales prices and time to market reflect a regression problem because the output is numeric and continuous. This means, given the combination of predictor values, the response value could fall anywhere along some continuous spectrum (e.g., the predicted sales price of a particular home could be between $80,000 and $755,000). The figure below illustrates average home sales prices as a function of two home features: year built and total square footage. Depending on the combination of these two features, the expected home sales price could fall anywhere along a plane. Figure 2.1: Average home sales price as a function of year built and total square footage. 2.2.2 Classification problems When the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a categorical outcome, we refer to this as a classification problem. Classification problems most commonly revolve around predicting a binary or multinomial response measure such as: Did a customer redeem a coupon (coded as yes/no or 1/0)? Did a customer churn (coded as yes/no or 1/0)? Did a customer click on our online ad (coded as yes/no or 1/0)? Classifying customer reviews: Binary: positive vs. negative. Multinomial: extremely negative to extremely positive on a 0–5 Likert scale. Figure 2.2: Classification problem modeling ‘Yes’/‘No’ response based on three features. However, when we apply machine learning models for classification problems, rather than predict a particular class (i.e., “yes” or “no”), we often want to predict the probability of a particular class (i.e., yes: 0.65, no: 0.35). By default, the class with the highest predicted probability becomes the predicted class. Consequently, even though we are performing a classification problem, we are still predicting a numeric output (probability). However, the essence of the problem still makes it a classification problem. Although there are machine learning algorithms that can be applied to regression problems but not classification and vice versa, many of the supervised learning algorithms we cover in this class can be applied to both. These algorithms have become the most popular machine learning applications in recent years. 2.3 Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning, in contrast to supervised learning, includes a set of statistical tools to better understand and describe your data, but performs the analysis without a target variable. In essence, unsupervised learning is concerned with identifying groups in a data set. The groups may be defined by the rows (i.e., clustering) or the columns (i.e., dimension reduction); however, the motive in each case is quite different. The goal of clustering is to segment observations into similar groups based on the observed variables; for example, to divide consumers into different homogeneous groups, a process known as market segmentation. In dimension reduction, we are often concerned with reducing the number of variables in a data set. For example, classical linear regression models break down in the presence of highly correlated features. Some dimension reduction techniques can be used to reduce the feature set to a potentially smaller set of uncorrelated variables. Such a reduced feature set is often used as input to downstream supervised learning models (e.g., principal component regression). Unsupervised learning is often performed as part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA). However, the exercise tends to be more subjective, and there is no simple goal for the analysis, such as prediction of a response. Furthermore, it can be hard to assess the quality of results obtained from unsupervised learning methods. The reason for this is simple. If we fit a predictive model using a supervised learning technique (i.e., linear regression), then it is possible to check our work by seeing how well our model predicts the response Y on observations not used in fitting the model. However, in unsupervised learning, there is no way to check our work because we don’t know the true answer—the problem is unsupervised! Despite its subjectivity, the importance of unsupervised learning should not be overlooked and such techniques are often used in organizations to: Divide consumers into different homogeneous groups so that tailored marketing strategies can be developed and deployed for each segment. Identify groups of online shoppers with similar browsing and purchase histories, as well as items that are of particular interest to the shoppers within each group. Then an individual shopper can be preferentially shown the items in which he or she is particularly likely to be interested, based on the purchase histories of similar shoppers. Identify products that have similar purchasing behavior so that managers can manage them as product groups. These questions, and many more, can be addressed with unsupervised learning. Moreover, the outputs of unsupervised learning models can be used as inputs to downstream supervised learning models. 2.4 Machine Learning in Historically, the R ecosystem provides a wide variety of ML algorithm implementations. This has its benefits; however, this also has drawbacks as it requires the users to learn many different formula interfaces and syntax nuances. More recently, development on a group of packages called Tidymodels has helped to make implementation easier. The tidymodels collection allows you to perform discrete parts of the ML workflow with discrete packages: rsample for data splitting and resampling recipes for data pre-processing and feature engineering parsnip for applying algorithms tune for hyperparameter tuning yardstick for measuring model performance and several others! Throughout this course you’ll be exposed to several of these packages. Go ahead and make sure you have the following packages installed. Just like the tidyverse package, when you install tidymodels you are actually installing several packages that exist in the tidymodels ecosystem as discussed above. # common data wrangling and visualization install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;vip&quot;) install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) # modeling install.packages(&quot;tidymodels&quot;) packageVersion(&quot;tidymodels&quot;) ## [1] &#39;0.2.0&#39; library(tidymodels) 2.5 The data sets The data sets chosen for this course allow us to illustrate the different features of the presented machine learning algorithms. Since the goal of this course is to demonstrate how to implement ML workflows, we make the assumption that you have already spent significant time wrangling, cleaning and getting to know your data via exploratory data analysis. This would allow you to perform many necessary tasks prior to the ML tasks outlined in this course such as: Feature selection (i.e., removing unnecessary variables and retaining only those variables you wish to include in your modeling process). Recoding variable names and values so that they are meaningful and more interpretable. Tidying data so that each column is a discrete variable and each row is an individual observation. Recoding, removing, or some other approach to handling missing values. Consequently, the exemplar data sets we use throughout this book have, for the most part, gone through the necessary cleaning processes. As mentioned above, these data sets are fairly common data sets that provide good benchmarks to compare and illustrate ML workflows. Although some of these data sets are available in R, we will import these data sets from a .csv file to ensure consistency over time. 2.5.1 Boston housing The Boston Housing data set is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA.

It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. problem type: supervised multinomial classification response variable: species (i.e. “setosa”, “virginica”, “versicolor”) features: 4 observations: 150 objective: use plant leaf attributes to predict the type of flower # access data iris &lt;- readr::read_csv(here(data_path, &quot;iris.csv&quot;)) # initial dimension dim(iris) ## [1] 150 5 # features dplyr::select(iris, -Species) ## # A tibble: 150 × 4 ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 ## 2 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 ## 5 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 ## 8 5 3.4 1.5 0.2 ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 ## # … with 140 more rows ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows # response variable head(iris$Species) ## [1] &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;setosa&quot; 2.5.4 Ames housing The Ames housing data set is an alternative to the Boston housing data set and provides a more comprehensive set of home features to predict sales price.

The 1986 and career statistics were obtained from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.

The focus is to have an intuitive understanding of each discrete sub-task and algorithm. Once you understand when, where, and why these sub-tasks are performed you will be able to transfer this knowledge to other projects. The concepts you will learn include: Provide an overview of the ML modeling process: data splitting model fitting model validation and tuning performance measurement feature engineering Cover common supervised learners: linear regression regularized regression K-nearest neighbors decision trees bagging &amp; random forests gradient boosting Cover common unsupervised learners: K-means clustering Principal component analysis Along the way you’ll learn about: each algorithm’s hyperparameters model interpretation feature importance and more! 2.7 Exercises Identify four real-life applications of supervised and unsupervised problems. Explain what makes these problems supervised versus unsupervised. For each problem identify the target variable (if applicable) and potential features. Identify and contrast a regression problem with a classification problem. What is the target variable in each problem and why would being able to accurately predict this target be beneficial to society? What are potential features and where could you collect this information? What is determining if the problem is a regression or a classification problem? Identify three open source data sets suitable for machine learning (e.g., https://bit.ly/35wKu5c). Explain the type of machine learning models that could be constructed from the data (e.g., supervised versus unsupervised and regression versus classification). What are the dimensions of the data? Is there a code book that explains who collected the data, why it was originally collected, and what each variable represents? If the data set is suitable for supervised learning, which variable(s) could be considered as a useful target? Which variable(s) could be considered as features? Identify examples of misuse of machine learning in society. What was the ethical concern?

With minimal knowledge of the problem or data at hand, it is difficult to know which ML method will perform best. This is known as the no free lunch theorem for ML (Wolpert 1996). Consequently, it is common for many ML approaches to be applied, evaluated, and modified before a final, optimal model can be determined. Performing this process correctly provides great confidence in our outcomes. If not, the results will be useless and, potentially, damaging.1 Approaching ML modeling correctly means approaching it strategically by spending our data wisely on learning and validation procedures, properly pre-processing the feature variables, minimizing data leakage, tuning hyperparameters, and assessing model performance. Many books and courses portray the modeling process as a short sprint. A better analogy would be a marathon where many iterations of these steps are repeated before eventually finding the final optimal model. This process is illustrated below. Figure 3.1: General predictive machine learning process. Before introducing specific algorithms, this lesson, along with the next module, introduces concepts that are fundamental to the ML modeling process and that you’ll see briskly covered in future modeling lessons. More specifically, this lesson is designed to get you acquainted with building predictive models using the Tidymodels construct. We’ll focus on the process of splitting our data for improved generalizability, using Tidymodel’s parsnip package for constructing our models, along with yardstick to measure model performance. The tidymodels framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. 3.1 Learning objectives By the end of this lesson you will be able to: Split your data into training and test sets. Instantiate, train, fit, and evaluate a basic model. 3.2 Prerequisites For this lesson we’ll primarily use the tidymodels package. library(tidymodels) library(here) The two data sets we’ll use are ames and attrition. data_path &lt;- here(&quot;data&quot;) ames &lt;- readr::read_csv(here(data_path, &quot;ames.csv&quot;)) attrition &lt;- readr::read_csv(here(data_path, &quot;attrition.csv&quot;)) When performing classification models our response variable needs to be a factor (or sometimes as 0 vs. 1). Consequently, the code chunk below sets the Attrition response variable as a factor rather than as a character. attrition &lt;- attrition %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(Attrition = as.factor(Attrition)) 3.3 Data splitting A major goal of the machine learning process is to find an algorithm \\(f\\left(X\\right)\\) that most accurately predicts future values (\\(\\hat{Y}\\)) based on a set of features (\\(X\\)). In other words, we want an algorithm that not only fits well to our past data, but more importantly, one that predicts a future outcome accurately. This is called the generalizability of our algorithm. How we “spend” our data will help us understand how well our algorithm generalizes to unseen data. To provide an accurate understanding of the generalizability of our final optimal model, we can split our data into training and test data sets: Training set: these data are used to develop feature sets, train our algorithms, tune hyperparameters, compare models, and all of the other activities required to choose a final model (e.g., the model we want to put into production). Test set: having chosen a final model, these data are used to estimate an unbiased assessment of the model’s performance, which we refer to as the generalization error. Figure 3.2: Splitting data into training and test sets. Given a fixed amount of data, typical recommendations for splitting your data into training-test splits include 60% (training)–40% (testing), 70%–30%, or 80%–20%. Generally speaking, these are appropriate guidelines to follow; however, it is good to keep the following points in mind: Spending too much in training (e.g., \\(&gt;80\\%\\)) won’t allow us to get a good assessment of predictive performance. We may find a model that fits the training data very well, but is not generalizable (overfitting). Sometimes too much spent in testing (\\(&gt;40\\%\\)) won’t allow us to get a good assessment of model parameters. Other factors should also influence the allocation proportions. For example, very large training sets (e.g., \\(n &gt; 100\\texttt{K}\\)) often result in only marginal gains compared to smaller sample sizes. Consequently, you may use a smaller training sample to increase computation speed (e.g., models built on larger training sets often take longer to score new data sets in production). In contrast, as \\(p \\geq n\\) (where \\(p\\) represents the number of features), larger samples sizes are often required to identify consistent signals in the features. The two most common ways of splitting data include simple random sampling and stratified sampling. 3.3.1 Simple random sampling The simplest way to split the data into training and test sets is to take a simple random sample. This does not control for any data attributes, such as the distribution of your response variable (\\(Y\\)). Sampling is a random process so setting the random number generator with a common seed allows for reproducible results. Throughout this course we’ll often use the seed 123 for reproducibility but the number itself has no special meaning. # create train/test split set.seed(123) # for reproducibility split &lt;- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7) train &lt;- training(split) test &lt;- testing(split) # dimensions of training data dim(train) ## [1] 2051 81 With sufficient sample size, this sampling approach will typically result in a similar distribution of \\(Y\\) (e.g., Sale_Price in the ames data) between your training and test sets, as illustrated below. train %&gt;% mutate(id = &#39;train&#39;) %&gt;% bind_rows(test %&gt;% mutate(id = &#39;test&#39;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Sale_Price, color = id)) + geom_density() 3.3.2 Stratified sampling If we want to explicitly control the sampling so that our training and test sets have similar \\(Y\\) distributions, we can use stratified sampling. This is more common with classification problems where the response variable may be severely imbalanced (e.g., 90% of observations with response “Yes” and 10% with response “No”). However, we can also apply stratified sampling to regression problems for data sets that have a small sample size and where the response variable deviates strongly from normality. With a continuous response variable, stratified sampling will segment \\(Y\\) into quantiles and randomly sample from each. To perform stratified sampling we simply apply the strata argument in initial_split. set.seed(123) split_strat &lt;- initial_split(attrition, prop = 0.7, strata = &quot;Attrition&quot;) train_strat &lt;- training(split_strat) test_strat &lt;- testing(split_strat) The following illustrates that in our original employee attrition data we have an imbalanced response (No: 84%, Yes: 16%). By enforcing stratified sampling, both our training and testing sets have approximately equal response distributions. # original response distribution table(attrition$Attrition) %&gt;% prop.table() ## ## No Yes ## 0.8387755 0.1612245 # response distribution for training data table(train_strat$Attrition) %&gt;% prop.table() ## ## No Yes ## 0.8394942 0.1605058 # response distribution for test data table(test_strat$Attrition) %&gt;% prop.table() ## ## No Yes ## 0.8371041 0.1628959 3.3.3 Knowledge check Import the penguins data from the modeldata package Create a 70-30 stratified train-test split (species is the target variable). What are the response variable proportions for the train and test data sets? 3.4 Building models The R ecosystem provides a wide variety of ML algorithm implementations. This makes many powerful algorithms available at your fingertips. Moreover, there are almost always more than one package to perform each algorithm (e.g., there are over 20 packages for fitting random forests). There are pros and cons to this wide selection; some implementations may be more computationally efficient while others may be more flexible. This also has resulted in some drawbacks as there are inconsistencies in how algorithms allow you to define the formula of interest and how the results and predictions are supplied. Fortunately, the tidymodels ecosystem is simplifying this and, in particular, the Parsnip package provides one common interface to train many different models supplied by other packages. Consequently, we’ll focus on building models the tidymodels way. To create and fit a model with parsnip we follow 3 steps: Create a model type Choose an “engine” Fit our model Let’s illustrate by building a linear regression model. For our first model we will simply use two features from our training data - total square feet of the home (Gr_Liv_Area) and year built (Year_Built) to predict the sale price (Sale_Price). We can use tidy() to get results of our model’s parameter estimates and their statistical properties. Although the summary() function can provide this output, it gives the results back in an unwieldy format. Many models have a tidy() method that provides the summary results in a more predictable and useful format (e.g. a data frame with standard column names) lm_ols &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + Year_Built, data = train) tidy(lm_ols) ## # A tibble: 3 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -2157423. 69234. -31.2 8.09e-175 ## 2 Gr_Liv_Area 94.4 2.12 44.4 2.54e-302 ## 3 Year_Built 1114. 35.5 31.4 5.30e-177 Now, you may have noticed that I only applied two of the three steps I mentioned previously: Create a model type Choose an “engine” Fit our model The reason is because most model objects (linear_reg() in this example) have a default engine. linear_reg() by default uses lm for ordinary least squares. But we can always change the engine. For example, say I wanted to use keras to perform gradient descent linear regression, then I could change the engine to keras but use the same code workflow. For this code to run successfully on your end you need to have the keras and tensorflow packages installed on your machine. Depending on your current setup this could be an easy process or you could run into problems. If you run into problems don’t fret, this is primarily just to illustrate how we can change engines. lm_sgd &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% set_engine(&#39;keras&#39;) %&gt;% fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + Year_Built, data = train) When we talk about ‘engines’ we’re really just referring to packages that provide the desired algorithm. Each model object has different engines available to use and they are all documented. For example check out the help file for linear_reg (?linear_reg) and you’ll see the different engines available (lm, brulee, glm, glmnet, etc.) The beauty of this workflow is that if we want to explore different models we can simply change the model object. For example, say we wanted to run a K-nearest neighbor model. We can just use nearest_neighbor(). In this example we have pretty much the same code as above except we added the line of code set_mode(). This is because most algorithms require you to specify if you are building a regression model or a classification model. When you run this code you’ll probably get an error message saying that “This engine requires some package installs: ‘kknn’.” This just means you need to install.packages(‘kknn’) and then you should be able to successfully run this code. knn &lt;- nearest_neighbor() %&gt;% set_engine(&quot;kknn&quot;) %&gt;% set_mode(&quot;regression&quot;) %&gt;% fit(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + Year_Built, data = train) You can see all the different model objects available at https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html 3.4.1 Knowledge check If you haven’t already done so, create a 70-30 stratified train-test split on the attrition data (note: Attrition is the response variable). Using the logistic_reg() model object, fit a model using Age, DistanceFromHome, and JobLevel as the features. Now train a K-nearest neighbor model using the ‘kknn’ engine and be sure to set the mode to be a classification model. 3.5 Making predictions We have fit a few different models. Now, if we want to see our predictions we can simply apply predict() and feed it the data set we want to make predictions on. Here, we can see the predictions made on our training data for our ordinary least square linear regression model. lm_ols %&gt;% predict(train) ## # A tibble: 2,051 × 1 ## .pred ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 217657. ## 2 214276. ## 3 223425. ## 4 260324. ## 5 109338. ## 6 195106. ## 7 222217. ## 8 126175. ## 9 98550. ## 10 120811. ## # … with 2,041 more rows ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows And here we get the predicted values for our KNN model. knn %&gt;% predict(train) ## # A tibble: 2,051 × 1 ## .pred ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 194967. ## 2 192240 ## 3 174220 ## 4 269760 ## 5 113617. ## 6 173672 ## 7 174820 ## 8 120796 ## 9 114560 ## 10 121346 ## # … with 2,041 more rows ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows 3.5.1 Knowledge check Make predictions on the test data using the logistic regression model you built on the attrition data. Now make predictions using the K-nearest neighbor model. 3.6 Evaluating model performance It is important to understand how our model is performing. With ML models, measuring performance means understanding the predictive accuracy – the difference between a predicted value and the actual value. We measure predictive accuracy with loss functions. There are many loss functions to choose from when assessing the performance of a predictive model, each providing a unique understanding of the predictive accuracy and differing between regression and classification models. Furthermore, the way a loss function is computed will tend to emphasize certain types of errors over others and can lead to drastic differences in how we interpret the “optimal model”. Its important to consider the problem context when identifying the preferred performance metric to use. And when comparing multiple models, we need to compare them across the same metric. 3.6.1 Regression models The most common loss functions for regression models include: MSE: Mean squared error is the average of the squared error (\\(MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \\hat y_i)^2\\))2. The squared component results in larger errors having larger penalties. Objective: minimize RMSE: Root mean squared error. This simply takes the square root of the MSE metric (\\(RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \\hat y_i)^2}\\)) so that your error is in the same units as your response variable. If your response variable units are dollars, the units of MSE are dollars-squared, but the RMSE will be in dollars. Objective: minimize Let’s compute the RMSE of our OLS regression model. Remember, we want to assess our model’s performance on the test data not the training data since that gives us a better idea of how our model generalizes. To do so, the following: Makes predictions with our test data, Adds the actual Sale_Price values from our test data, Computes the RMSE. lm_ols %&gt;% predict(test) %&gt;% bind_cols(test %&gt;% select(Sale_Price)) %&gt;% rmse(truth = Sale_Price, estimate = .pred) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## .metric .estimator .estimate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 rmse standard 45445. The RMSE value suggests that, on average, our model mispredicts the expected sale price of a home by about $45K. 3.6.2 Classification models There are many loss functions used for classification models. For simplicity we’ll just focus on the overall classification accuracy. I’ll illustrate with the attrition data. Here, we build a logistic regression model that seeks to predicts Attrition based on all available features. In R, using a “.” as in Attrition ~ . is a shortcut for saying use all available features to predict Attrition. We then follow the same process as above to make predictions on the test data, add the actual test values for Attrition, and then compute the accuracy rate. logit &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;% fit(Attrition ~ ., data = train_strat) logit %&gt;% predict(test_strat) %&gt;% bind_cols(test_strat %&gt;% select(Attrition)) %&gt;% accuracy(truth = Attrition, estimate = .pred_class) ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## .metric .estimator .estimate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 accuracy binary 0.876 3.6.3 Knowledge check Compute the accuracy rate of your logistic regression model for the attrition data. Now compute the accuracy rate of your K-nearest neighbor model. 3.7 Exercises For this exercise we’ll use the Boston housing data set. The Boston Housing data set is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. Originally published in Harrison Jr and Rubinfeld (1978), it contains 13 attributes to predict the median property value. Data attributes: problem type: supervised regression response variable: medv median value of owner-occupied homes in USD 1000’s (i.e. 21.8, 24.5) features: 13 observations: 506 objective: use property attributes to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes Modeling tasks: Import the Boston housing data set (boston.csv) and split it into a training set and test set using a 70-30% split. How many observations are in the training set and test set? Compare the distribution of cmedv between the training set and test set. Fit a linear regression model using all available features to predict cmedv and compute the RMSE on the test data. Fit a K-nearest neighbor model that uses all available features to predict cmedv and compute the RMSE on the test data. How do these models compare?
