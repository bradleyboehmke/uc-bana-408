================

This repository contains additional resources for the UC BANA 4080 Data Mining course. The following is a truncated syllabus; for the full syllabus along with complete course content please visit the online course content in [Canvas](https://uc.instructure.com/). 


## Course Description

Welcome to Data Mining! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to data mining and analysis techniques. You will learn the fundamental skills required to extract informative attributes, relationships, and patterns from datasets. You will gain hands-on experience with exploratory data analysis, data visualization, unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and dimension reduction, and supervised learning techniques such as linear regression, regularized regression, decision trees, random forests, and more! You will also be exposed to some more advanced topics such as deep learning, model stacking, autoML, and model interpretation. Together, this will provide you with a solid foundation of tools and techniques applied in organizations to aid modern day data-driven decision making.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

* Apply data wrangling techniques to manipulate and prepare data for analysis.
* Use exploratory data analysis and visualization to provide descriptive insights of data.
* Apply common unsupervised learning algorithms to find common groupings of observations and features in a given dataset.
* Describe and apply a sound analytic modeling process.
* Apply, compare, and contrast various predictive modeling techniques.
* Have the resources and understanding to continue advancing your data mining and analysis capabilities.
