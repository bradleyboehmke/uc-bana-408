# (PART) Module 2 {-}

# Overview

The last couple of lessons gave you a good introduction to building predictive models using the Tidymodels construct. However, before we even try to improve upon performance by changing the algorithm, we can likely improve model performance through two three steps:

1. Making our predictive variables more relevant to modeling with ___feature engineering___.
2. Improving the generalization of our model with ___resampling procedures___.
3. Balancing the bias and variance in our models with ___hyperparameter tuning___.

This module introduces these concepts and illustrates how to implement these procedures with Tidymodels.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Apply feature engineering steps to preprocess numeric and categorical data.
- Perform resampling and hyperparameter grid search procedures for robust model evaluation and selection.

## Estimated time requirement

The estimated time to go through the module lessons is about 3 hours.

## Tasks

```{block, type='todo'}
* Work through the 2 module lessons.
* Upon finishing each lesson take the associated lesson quizzes on Canvas. Be sure to complete the lesson quiz no later than the due date listed on Canvas.
* Check Canvas for this week's lab, lab quiz due date, and any additional content (i.e. in-class material)
```
