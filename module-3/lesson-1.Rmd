Data preprocessing and engineering techniques generally refer to the addition, deletion, or transformation of data. In this lesson we introduce you to another tidymodels package, [**recipes**](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/), which is designed to help you preprocess your data before training your model. Recipes are built as a series of preprocessing steps, such as:

* converting qualitative predictors to indicator variables (also known as dummy variables),
* transforming data to be on a different scale (e.g., taking the logarithm of a variable),
* transforming whole groups of predictors together,
 extracting key features from raw variables (e.g., getting the day of the week out of a date variable),

and so on. Although there is an ever-growing number of ways to preprocess your data, we'll focus on a few common feature engineering steps applied to numeric and categorical data. This will provide you with a foundation of how to perform feature engineering.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson you’ll be able to:

* Explain how to apply feature engineering steps with the **recipes** package.
* Filter out low informative features.
* Normalize and standardize numeric features.
* Pre-process nominal and ordinal features.
* Combine multiple feature engineering steps into one recipe and train a model with it.

## Prerequisites

For this lesson we'll use the **recipes** package with is automatically loaded with **tidymodels** and we'll use the `ames.csv` housing data.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

ames_data_path <- here::here("data", "ames.csv")
ames <- readr::read_csv(ames_data_path)
```

Let's go ahead and create our train-test split:

```{r 3a-train-test-split}
# create train/test split
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
split  <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.7)
ames_train  <- training(split)
ames_test   <- testing(split)
```


## Create a recipe

```

To get started, let’s create a model recipe that we will build upon and apply in a model downstream. Before training the model, we can use a recipe to create and/or modify predictors and conduct some preprocessing required by the model.

```{r 3a-create-recipe}
ames_recipe <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train)
```

Similar to the `fit()` function you've already seen, the `recipe()` function has two primary arguments:

* A __formula__: Any variable on the left-hand side of the tilde (`~`) is considered the response variable (here, a`Sale_Price`). On the right-hand side of the tilde are the predictors. Variables may be listed by name, or you can use the dot (`.`) to indicate all other variables as predictors.
* The __data__: A recipe is associated with the data set used to create the model. This should always be the training set, so `data = ames_train` here. 

Now we can start adding feature engineering steps onto our recipe using the pipe operator and applying specific feature engineering tasks. The sections that follow provide some discussion as to why we apply each feature engineering step and then we demonstrate how to add it to our recipe.

## Numeric features

Pretty much all algorithms will work _out of the box_ with numeric features. However, some algorithms make some assumptions regarding the distribution of our features.  If we look at some of our numeric features, we can see that they span across different ranges:

```{r}
ames_train %>%
   select_if(is.numeric)
```

Moreover, sometimes our numeric features are skewed or contain outliers. For example, our `Gr_Liv_Area` feature is skewed right where most values are centered around 1200-1500 square feet of living space but there several larger than normal homes (i.e. `Gr_Liv_Area` > 3000). In fact, if we look at our scatter plot we can see that the right tail of `Gr_Liv_Area` values is where the largest residuals are.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=4}
p1 <- ggplot(ames_train, aes(Gr_Liv_Area)) +
   geom_histogram(bins = 100)

p2 <- ggplot(ames_train, aes(Gr_Liv_Area, Sale_Price)) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

We can incorporate feature engineering steps to help address both of the above concerns.

### Standardizing

```{block, type='video'}
<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1492301/sp/149230100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/49148882/partner_id/1492301?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_hnxmw14l&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en_US&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_i6qpa8sf" width="640" height="610" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="BANA 4080 - Standardizing numeric features"></iframe>
```

We should always consider the scale on which the individual features are measured. What are the largest and smallest values across all features and do they span several orders of magnitude? Models that incorporate smooth functions of input features are sensitive to the scale of the inputs. For example, $5X+2$ is a simple linear function of the input _X_, and the scale of its output depends directly on the scale of the input. Many algorithms use linear functions within their algorithms, some more obvious (e.g., ordinary least squares and regularized regression) than others (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines, and principal components analysis). Other examples include algorithms that use distance measures such as the Euclidean distance (e.g., _k_ nearest neighbor, _k_-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering). 

For these models and modeling components, it is often a good idea to standardize the features. Standardizing features includes _centering_ and _scaling_ so that numeric variables have zero mean and unit variance, which provides a common comparable unit of measure across all the variables.

```{block, type="tipe"}
Whether or not a machine learning model requires normalization of the features depends on the model family. Linear models such as logistic regression generally benefit from scaling the features while other models such as tree-based models (i.e. decision trees, random forests) do not need such preprocessing (but will not suffer from it).
```

```{r engineering-standardizing, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Standardizing features allows all features to be compared on a common value scale regardless of their real value differences.", fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
set.seed(123)
x1 <- tibble(
  variable = "x1",
  `Real value` = runif(25, min = -30, max = 5),
  `Standardized value` = scale(`Real value`) %>% as.numeric()
)
set.seed(456)
x2 <- tibble(
  variable = "x2",
  `Real value` = rlnorm(25, log(25)),
  `Standardized value` = scale(`Real value`) %>% as.numeric()
)
set.seed(789)
x3 <- tibble(
  variable = "x3",
  `Real value` = rnorm(25, 150, 15),
  `Standardized value` = scale(`Real value`) %>% as.numeric()
)
x1 %>%
  bind_rows(x2) %>%
  bind_rows(x3) %>%
  gather(key, value, -variable) %>%
  mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = c("x3", "x2", "x1"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, variable)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .6) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free_x") +
    ylab("Feature") +
    xlab("Value")
```

We can standardize our numeric features in one of two ways -- note that `step_normalize()` is just a wrapper that combines `step_center()` and `step_scale()`.

```{r 3a-standardize}
# option 1
std <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_center(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
   step_scale(all_numeric_predictors())

# option 2
std <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
```

Note how we did not specify an individual variable within our `step_xxx()` functions. You can certain do that if you wanted to. For example, if you just wanted to standardize the `Gr_Liv_Area` and `Year_Built` feature you could with:

```{r}
std <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_normalize(Gr_Liv_Area, Year_Built)
```

However, instead we used [selectors](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/selections.html) to apply this recipe step to all the numeric features at once using `all_nominal_predictors()`. The [selector functions](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/reference/selections.html) can be combined to select intersections of variables just like we learned several weeks ago with the `dplyr::select()` function.

```{block, type='note'}
The result of the above code is not to actually apply the feature engineering steps but, rather, to create an object that holds the feature engineering logic (or recipe) to be applied later on.
```

### Normalizing

```{block, type='video'}
<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1492301/sp/149230100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/49148882/partner_id/1492301?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_uiqeezk9&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en_US&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_6iofea0g" width="640" height="610" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="BANA 4080 - Normalizing numeric features"></iframe>
```

Parametric models that have distributional assumptions can benefit from minimizing the skewness of numeric features. For instance, ordinary linear regression models assume that the prediction errors are normally distributed. However, sometimes when certain features or even the response variable has heavy tails (i.e., outliers) or is skewed in one direction or the other, this normality assumption will likely not hold.  

There are two main approaches to help correct for skewed feature variables:

__Option 1__: normalize with a log transformation. This will transform most right skewed distributions to be approximately normal.

```{r}
ames_recipe %>%
   step_log(all_numeric_predictors())
```

However, if your feature(s) have negative values or zeros then a log transformation will produce NaNs and -Infs, respectively (you cannot take the logarithm of a negative number). If the non positive response values are small (say between -0.99 and 0) then you can apply a small offset such as in `log1p()` which adds 1 to the value prior to applying a log transformation (you can do the same within `step_log()` by using the offset argument). 

```{r, warning=TRUE}
log(-0.5)
log1p(-0.5)
```


If your data consists of values $\leq -1$, use the Yeo-Johnson transformation mentioned next.

__Option 2__: use a _Box Cox transformation_. A Box Cox transformation is more flexible than (but also includes as a special case) the log transformation and will find an appropriate transformation from a family of power transforms that will transform the variable as close as possible to a normal distribution [@box1964analysis; @carroll1981prediction]. At the core of the Box Cox transformation is an exponent, lambda ($\lambda$), which varies from -5 to 5. All values of $\lambda$ are considered and the optimal value for the given data is estimated from the training data; The "optimal value" is the one which results in the best transformation to an approximate normal distribution. The transformation of the response $Y$ has the form:

$$
 \begin{equation} 
 y(\lambda) =
\begin{cases}
   \frac{Y^\lambda-1}{\lambda}, & \text{if}\ \lambda \neq 0 \\
   \log\left(Y\right), & \text{if}\ \lambda = 0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$


```{block, type = "tip"}
If your response has negative values, the Yeo-Johnson transformation is very similar to the Box-Cox but does not require the input variables to be strictly positive. 
```

We can normalize our numeric predictor variables with `step_YeoJohnson()`:

```{r 3a-normalizing}
# normalize with Box Cox
norm_bc <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_BoxCox(all_numeric_predictors())

# Normalize with Yeo Johnson
norm_yj <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_YeoJohnson(all_numeric_predictors())                 
```

```

## Categorical features

Most models require that the predictors take numeric form.  There are exceptions; for example, some tree-based models naturally handle numeric or categorical features.  However, even tree-based models can benefit from pre-processing categorical features.  The following sections will discuss a few of the more common approaches to engineer categorical features.

### One-hot & dummy encoding

```{block, type='video'}
<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1492301/sp/149230100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/49148882/partner_id/1492301?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_wxfwm2tl&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en_US&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_ao6g9zcg" width="640" height="610" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="BANA 4080 - Dummy encoding categrical features"></iframe>
```


There are many ways to recode categorical variables as numeric. The most common is referred to as one-hot encoding, where we transpose our categorical variables so that each level of the feature is represented as a boolean value.  For example, one-hot encoding the left data frame in the below figure results in `X` being converted into three columns, one for each level. This is called less than _full rank_ encoding .  However, this creates perfect collinearity which causes problems with some predictive modeling algorithms (e.g., ordinary linear regression and neural networks).  Alternatively, we can create a full-rank encoding by dropping one of the levels (level `c` has been dropped). This is referred to as _dummy_ encoding. 

```{r engineering-one-hot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Eight observations containing a categorical feature X and the difference in how one-hot and dummy encoding transforms this feature.', out.height="99%", out.width="99%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here(img_path, "ohe-vs-dummy.png"))
```

We can use `step_dummy()` to add a one-hot or dummy encoding to our recipe:

```{r 3a-engineering-ohe}
# one-hot encode
ohe <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE)

# dummy encode
de <- ames_recipe %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = FALSE)
```

```{block, type = "note"}
Recall our lesson on applying an ordinary least squares regression model to a categorical feature. Behind the scenes R was automatically dummy encoding our categorical feature; however, many (dare I say most) algorithms will not automatically do that for us. 
```


### Ordinal encoding

```{block, type='video'}
<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1492301/sp/149230100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/49148882/partner_id/1492301?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_0sdinn1q&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en_US&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_c1rvdi04" width="640" height="610" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="BANA 4080 - Ordinal encoding categrical features"></iframe>
```


If a categorical feature is naturally ordered then numerically encoding the feature based on its order is a natural choice (most commonly referred to as ordinal encoding).  For example, the various quality features in the Ames housing data are ordinal in nature (ranging from `Very_Poor` to `Very_Excellent`).

```{r engineering-qual-variables}
ames_train %>% select(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'))
```

Ordinal encoding these features provides a natural and intuitive interpretation and can logically be applied to all models.

If your features are already ordered factors then you can simply apply `step_ordinalscore()` to ordinal encode:

```{r}
ord <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_ordinalscore(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'))
```

However, if we look at our quality features we see they are characters instead of factors and their levels are not ordered. Moreover, some have a unique value that represents that feature doesn't exist in the house (i.e. `No_Basement`).

```{r}
ames_train %>% pull(Bsmt_Qual) %>% unique()
```

So in this case we're going to apply several feature engineering steps to:

1. convert quality features to factors with specified levels,
2. convert any missed levels (i.e. No_Basement, No_Pool) to "None",
3. convert factor level to integer value ('Very_Poor' = 1, 'Poor' = 2, ..., 
'Excellent' = 10, 'Very_Excellent' = 11)


```{r}
# specify levels in order
lvls <- c("Very_Poor", "Poor", "Fair", "Below_Average", "Average", "Typical", 
          "Above_Average", "Good", "Very_Good", "Excellent", "Very_Excellent")

# apply ordinal encoding to quality features
ord_lbl <- ames_recipe %>%
   # 1. convert quality features to factors with specified levels
   step_string2factor(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'), levels = lvls, ordered = TRUE) %>% 
   # 2. convert any missed levels (i.e. No_Basement, No_Pool) to "None"
   step_unknown(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'), new_level = "None") %>%
   # 3. convert factor level to integer value
   step_ordinalscore(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'))
```

Did this work, let's take a look. If we want to apply a recipe to a data set we can apply:

* `prep`:  estimate feature engineering parameters based on training data.
* `bake`: apply the prepped recipe to new, or the existing (`new_data = NULL`) data.

We can see that our quality variables are now ordinal encoded.

```{r check-ord-encoding}
baked_recipe <- ord_lbl %>%
   prep(strings_as_factor = FALSE) %>%
   bake(new_data = NULL)

baked_recipe %>% select(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'))
```

And if we want to see how the numeric values are mapped to the original data we can. Here, I just focus on the original `Overall_Qual` values and how they compare to the encoded values.

```{r}
encoded_Overall_Qual <- baked_recipe %>% 
   select(Overall_Qual) %>%
   rename(encoded_Overall_Qual = Overall_Qual)

ames_train %>%
   select(Overall_Qual) %>%
   bind_cols(encoded_Overall_Qual) %>%
   count(Overall_Qual, encoded_Overall_Qual)
```

### Lumping

```{block, type='video'}

```


Sometimes features will contain levels that have very few observations.  For example, there are 28 unique neighborhoods represented in the Ames housing data but several of them only have a few observations.   

```{r engineering-overall-qual-levels, echo=FALSE}
count(ames_train, Neighborhood) %>% arrange(n)
```

Sometimes we can benefit from collapsing, or "lumping" these into a lesser number of categories.  In the above examples, we may want to collapse all levels that are observed in less than 1% of the training sample into an "other" category.  We can use `step_other()` to do so.  However, lumping should be used sparingly as there is often a loss in model performance [@apm].  

```{block, type="tip"}
Tree-based models often perform exceptionally well with high cardinality features and are not as impacted by levels with small representation.
```

The following lumps all neighborhoods that represent less than 1% of observations into an "other" category.

```{r}
# Lump levels for two features
rare_encoder <- ames_recipe %>%
   step_other(Neighborhood, threshold = 0.01, other = "other")
```

## Fit a model with a recipe

Alright, so we know how to do a little feature engineering, now let's put it to use.  Recall that we are using the `ames.csv` data rather than the `AmesHousing::make_ames()` data. Because of this if we were to try train a multiple linear regression model on all the predictors we would get an error when applying that model to unseen data (i.e. `ames_test`).

This is because there are some rare levels in some of the categorical features.

```{r, error=TRUE}
linear_reg() %>%
   fit(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train) %>%
   predict(ames_test) %>%
   bind_cols(ames_test) %>%
   rmse(truth = Sale_Price, estimate = .pred)
```

If we remove all the categorical features with rare levels we can train a model and apply it to our test data.

```{block, type="note"}
Note that our result differs from the last lesson because we are using `ames.csv` rather than the `AmesHousing::make_ames()` data and there are some subtle differences between those data sets.
```


```{r}
trbl_vars <- c("MS_SubClass", "Condition_2", "Exterior_1st", 
               "Exterior_2nd", "Misc_Feature", "Roof_Matl",
               "Electrical", "Sale_Type")
ames_smaller_train <- ames_train %>%
   select(-trbl_vars)

linear_reg() %>%
   fit(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_smaller_train) %>%
   predict(ames_test) %>%
   bind_cols(ames_test) %>%
   rmse(truth = Sale_Price, estimate = .pred)
```

Unfortunately, we dropped the troublesome categorical features which may actually have some useful information in them. Also, we may be able to improve performance by applying other feature engineering steps. Let's combine some feature engineering tasks into one recipe and then train a model with it.

```{r final_recipe}
final_recipe <- recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_train) %>%
   step_nzv(all_predictors(), unique_cut = 10) %>%
   step_YeoJohnson(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
   step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
   step_string2factor(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'), levels = lvls, ordered = TRUE) %>% 
   step_unknown(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$'), new_level = "None") %>%
   step_integer(matches('Qual$|QC$|_Cond$')) %>%
   step_other(all_nominal_predictors(), threshold = 0.01, other = "other")
```

We will want to use our recipe across several steps as we train and test our model. We will:

1. **Process the recipe using the training set**: This involves any estimation or calculations based on the training set. For our recipe, the training set will be used to determine which predictors will have zero-variance in the training set, and should be slated for removal, what the mean and scale is in order to standardize the numeric features, etc.

2. **Apply the recipe to the training set**: We create the final predictor set on the training set.

3. **Apply the recipe to the test set**: We create the final predictor set on the test set. Nothing is recomputed and no information from the test set is used here; the feature engineering statistics computed from the training set are applied to the test set.

To simplify this process, we can use a model workflow, which pairs a model and recipe together. This is a straightforward approach because different recipes are often needed for different models, so when a model and recipe are bundled, it becomes easier to train and test workflows. We’ll use the [**workflows** package](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/) from tidymodels to bundle our model with our recipe (`ames_recipe`).

```{r rf_model_workflow}
mlr_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(linear_reg()) %>% 
  add_recipe(final_recipe)

mlr_wflow
```

Now, there is a single function that can be used to prepare the recipe and train the model from the resulting predictors:

```{r fit_workflow}
mlr_fit <- mlr_wflow %>%
   fit(data = ames_train)
```

The `rf_fit` object has the finalized recipe and fitted model objects inside. You may want to extract the model or recipe objects from the workflow. To do this, you can use the helper functions `extract_fit_parsnip()` and `extract_recipe()`.

```{r}
mlr_fit %>%
   extract_fit_parsnip() %>%
   tidy()
```

Just as in the last lesson, we can make predictions with our fit model object and evaluate the model performance. Here, we compute the RMSE on our `ames_test` data and we see we have a better performance than the previous model that had no feature engineering steps.

```{r}
mlr_fit %>%
   predict(ames_test) %>%
   bind_cols(ames_test %>% select(Sale_Price)) %>%
   rmse(truth = Sale_Price, estimate = .pred)
```

### Knowledge check

```{block, type='todo'}
Using the boston_train data, fill in the blanks to train a model with the given recipe...

* The recipe should model `cmedv` as a function of all predictors,
* standardizes all numeric features,
* Normalizes all all numeric features with a Yeo-Johnson transformation
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Create recipe
boston_recipe <- recipe(_____ ~ _____, data = boston_train) %>%
  step______(_____) %>%
  step______(_____)

# 2. Create a workflow object
mlr_wflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(_____) %>% 
  add_recipe(_____)

# 3. Fit and evaluate our model like we did before
mlr_fit <- mlr_wflow %>%
   fit(data = boston_train)

mlr_fit %>%
   predict(boston_test) %>%
   bind_cols(boston_test %>% select(cmedv)) %>%
   rmse(truth = cmedv, estimate = .pred)
```

## Exercises

```{block, type = 'todo'}

1. Identify three new feature engineering steps that are provided by [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/). Why would these feature engineering steps be applicable to the Ames data?

2. Using the `boston.csv` data, create a multiple linear regression model using all predictors in their current state. Now apply feature engineering steps to standardize and normalize the numeric features prior to modeling. Does the model performance improve?

3. Using the `AmesHousing::make_ames()` rebuild the model we created in [this section](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/uc-bana-4080/lesson-2b-multiple-linear-regression.html#including-many-predictors). However, rather than remove the trouble variables, apply a feature engineering step to lump novel levels together so that you can use those variables as predictors. Does the model performance improve?
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
